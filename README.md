# zk-ico

ZkICO is a privacy-preserving platform that leverages the Aztec ↔ EVM bridge to enable users to participate in ICOs anonymously. By contributing assets confidentially on the Aztec network, users can receive tokens on EVM-compatible chains—without revealing their identity or transaction history.
The platform also allows anyone to create and launch their own anonymous ICO, providing a fully private fundraising experience.
